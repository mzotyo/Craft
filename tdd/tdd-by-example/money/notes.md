# Notes

Pattern: **Value Object** 
- The instance variables of the object never change once they have been set in the constructor.
- Operations needs to return a new object.

Rule: **Triangulation**
- We only generalize code when we have two examples or more. When the second example demands a more general solution, then and only then do we generalize.
