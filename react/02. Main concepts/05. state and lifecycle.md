# State and Lifecycle
[https://reactjs.org/docs/state-and-lifecycle.html](https://reactjs.org/docs/state-and-lifecycle.html)

Consider the ticking clock example from one of the previous sections. In Rendering Elements, we have only learned one way to update the UI. We call `ReactDOM.render()` to change the rendered output:


```
function tick() {
	const element = (
		<div>
			<h1>Hello world</h1>
			<h2> It is {Date().toLocaleTimeString()}!</h2>
		</div>
	);
	ReactDOM.render(element, document.getElementById('root'));
}

setInterval(tick, 1000);
```

In this section, we will learn how to make the Clock component truly reusable and encapsulated. It will set up its own timer and update itself every second.

We can start by encapsulating how the clock looks:

```
function Clock(props) {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
      <h2>It is, {props.date.toLocaleTimeString()}!</h2>
    </div>
  );
}

function tick(){
  ReactDOM.render(
    <Clock date={new Date()} />, 
    document.getElementById('root')
  );
}

setInterval(tick, 1000);
```

However, it misses a crucial requirement: the fact that the `Clock` sets up a timer and updates the UI every second should be an implementation detail of the `Clock`.

Ideally we want to write this once and have the `Clock` update itself:

```
ReactDOM.render(
  <Clock />,  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

To implement this, we need to add *“state”* to the Clock component.

>State is similar to props, but it is private and fully controlled by the component.

## Converting a Function to a Class

You can convert a function component like `Clock` to a class in five steps:

1. Create an `ES6` class, with the same name, that extends `React.Component`.
2. Add a single empty method to it called `render()`.
3. Move the body of the function into the `render()` method.
4. Replace `props` with `this.props` in the `render()` body.
5. Delete the remaining empty function declaration.

```
class Clock2 extends React.Component {
  render() {
      return (
          <div>
              <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
              <h2>It is, {this.props.date.toLocaleTimeString()}!</h2>
          </div>
    );
  }
}

```

## Adding Local State to a Class 

We will move the `date` from props to state in three steps:

1. Replace `this.props.date` with `this.state.date` in the render() method:

```
class Clock extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
        <h2>It is {this.state.date.toLocaleTimeString()}.</h2>      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

2. Add a `class constructor` that assigns the initial `this.state`:

```
class Clock extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
  	super(props);
  	this.state = {date: new Date()};
  }
  
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
        <h2>It is {this.state.date.toLocaleTimeString()}.</h2>      
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

3. Remove the date prop from the `<Clock />` element:

```
ReactDOM.render(
  <Clock />,  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

## Adding Lifecycle Methods to a Class

In applications with many components, it’s very important to free up resources taken by the components when they are destroyed.

We want to set up a timer whenever the `Clock` is rendered to the DOM for the first time. This is called “mounting” in React.

We also want to clear that timer whenever the DOM produced by the `Clock` is removed. This is called *“unmounting”* in React.

```
class Clock extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {date: new Date()};
  }

  componentDidMount() {  
  	this.timerID = setInterval(
       () => this.tick(),      
  	   1000    
	);
  }
  
  componentWillUnmount() {
      clearInterval(this.timerID);
  }
  
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
        <h2>It is {this.state.date.toLocaleTimeString()}.</h2>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```
