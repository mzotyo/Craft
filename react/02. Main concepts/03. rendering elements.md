# Rendering elements
[https://reactjs.org/docs/rendering-elements.html](https://reactjs.org/docs/rendering-elements.html)

Elements are the smallest building blocks of React apps.

`element = <h1>Hello, world</h1>;`

Unlike browser DOM elements, React elements are plain objects, and are cheap to create. React DOM takes care of updating the DOM to match the React elements.

## Rendering an Element into the DOM 
Let’s say there is a `<div>` somewhere in your HTML file:

```
<div id="root"></div>
```

To render a React element into a root DOM node, pass both to `ReactDOM.render()`:

```
const element = <h1>Hello, world</h1>;
ReactDOM.render(element, document.getElementById('root'));
```

## Updating the Rendered Element 
React elements are immutable. Once you create an element, you can’t change its children or attributes.

With our knowledge so far, the only way to update the UI is to create a new element, and pass it to `ReactDOM.render()`.

Ticking clock example:

```
function tick() {
	const element = (
		<div>
			<h1>Hello, world!</h1>
			<h2>It is {new Date().toLocaleTimeString()}.</h2>
		</div>
	);
	ReactDOM.render(element, document.getElementById('root'));
}

setInterval(tick, 1000);
```

Most React apps only call `ReactDOM.render()` once. In practice such code gets encapsulated into stateful components.

## React Only Updates What’s Necessary
React DOM compares the element and its children to the previous one, and only applies the DOM updates necessary to bring the DOM to the desired state.
