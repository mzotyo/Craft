# Componenets and props
[https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html](https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html)

Components let you split the UI into independent, reusable pieces, and think about each piece in isolation. Conceptually, components are like JavaScript functions. They accept arbitrary inputs (called “props”) and return React elements describing what should appear on the screen.

## Function and Class Components 

The simplest way to define a component is to write a JavaScript function:

```
function Welcome(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>;
}
```

This function is a valid React component because it accepts a single *“props”* (which stands for properties) object argument with data and returns a React element. We call such components *“function components”* because they are literally JavaScript functions.

You can also use an ES6 class to define a component:

```
class Welcome extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <h1>Hello, {this.props.name}</h1>;
  }
}
```

The above two components are equivalent from React’s point of view.

## Rendering a Component

```
const element = <Welcome name="John Doe" />;
```

When React sees an element representing a user-defined component, it passes JSX attributes and children to this component as a single object. We call this object “props”.

Example: 

```
function Welcome(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}!</h1>;
}

const element = <Welcome name="Sara" />
```
